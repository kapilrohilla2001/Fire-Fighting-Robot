# Fire-Fighting-Robot
In this project, a danger-avoidance robot is presented, which can independently identify and, if necessary, eliminate fire. It employs flame sensors, Arduino UNO, and other hardware to identify flames, and move towards them, and dispense water effectively to douse fire.

# Features
Fire Detection: Equipped with three flame sensors for a wide detection range.
Autonomous Navigation: Uses motor controls to move towards the fire based on sensor input.
Water Spray System: Includes a water pump and servo motor for precise and targeted fire extinguishing.
Real-Time Processing: Powered by Arduino UNO for fast and reliable decision-making.

# Components Used
Flame sensors x 3
Arduino UNO
Chassis
BO motors x 4 (+ wheels)
L298 Motor Driver
Solder-less Breadboard
Mini Servo Motor
5-9V Water Pump + Pipe
Water Tank/Bottle
3.7V Batteries (18650) x 2
Jumper Wires
TIP-122 Transistor, 104 ÂµF Capacitor, and 1K Resistor

# How It Works
Fire Detection: Flame sensors detect the presence and direction of fire.
Movement Control: The robot navigates towards the flame using data from the sensors.
Fire Extinguishing: The water pump and servo motor work together to extinguish the flame accurately.
Power Management: Powered by 3.7V batteries with a TIP-122 transistor circuit for efficient pump operation.

# Challenges Faced
Sensor Calibration: Adjusting sensitivity to avoid false positives.
Power Optimization: Balancing the power supply for the motors, pump, and Arduino.
Motor Synchronization: Ensuring smooth navigation even with simultaneous sensor triggers.

# Future Improvements
Adding a wireless camera for remote monitoring.
Enhancing the water spray system for better efficiency.
Expanding fire detection range with additional sensors.

# Applications
Can be used in small-scale fire-fighting scenarios.
Serves as a learning project for robotics and IoT enthusiasts.
